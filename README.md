## Run

### Development

```bash
# run
yarn start:dev
```

## Deployment

this repo is a submodule in https://github.com/Waddah-JD/russian-vocabulary-flash-cards, all deployments happen on parent repo (check https://github.com/Waddah-JD/russian-vocabulary-flash-cards#deployment), the only required action on here is pushing to `master`

## TODO

- get rid of from Redux for state management, because that was a mistake, it requires too much boilerplate with almost 0 added value
